Waline has built-in multi-language support, and you can also customize Waline's locale config.

<!-- more -->

## Set Language

You can set the language used by Waline through the `lang` option. The supported languages are:

- zh
- zh-CN
- zh-TW
- en
- en-US
- jp
- jp-JP
- pt-BR
- ru
- ru-RU
- fr-FR
- fr

E.g.:

```js
Waline.init({
  el: '#waline',
  // ...
  lang: 'en',
});
```

::: tip

If you want to help Waline add more language support, we welcome you to send a PR to [client/config/i18n](https://github.com/walinejs/waline/tree/main/packages/client/src/config/i18n).

## Customize

You can customize the language through the `locale` option, or set some fields to overwrite the existing UI text.

For details, see [Cookbook → Customize Locale](../../cookbook/customize/locale.md)
